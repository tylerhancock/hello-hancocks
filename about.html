              <p class="text">It was over ten years ago that Tyler and Sarah went on their very first date after meeting through friends at Garden City High School. Sarah, a ruthless fifteen year old, then immediately broke up with Tyler - a choice that Tyler will not let her forget.</p>
              <p class="text">High school, college, and first jobs rambled on, until seven years later when luck was decidedly on Sarah’s side. Luck (also known as the Long Island Railroad) brought them back into each others' lives. It was four years ago that the soon-to-be newlyweds met once again on the fateful 5:33pm from Penn Station to Merillon Avenue, and rekindled their friendship, which quickly turned to love.</p>

              <p class="text">As their love story continued, it was all but evident that it was based loosely off of the 1987 classic, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. Sarah and Tyler spent over a year dating long distance between Long Island and Cape May. Sarah took up a hobby of riding the New Jersey Transit bus to Atlantic City to meet her beau on weekends, and Tyler spent many long car rides back and forth, back and forth, occasionally leaving his house keys (and always his heart) behind in New York. Over time the distance shortened - from Sarah’s Brooklyn apartment to Tyler’s home on Long Island, from one side of Nassau Boulevard to the other, until Tyler and Sarah finally found their home together in Forest Hills.</p>
